Please see
``$GEOIPS_PACKAGES_DIR/geoips/CHANGELOG_TEMPLATE.rst``
for instructions on updating CHANGELOG appropriately
with each PR.

The release note that is currently, actively being updated in
all geoips plugin repositories can be found in the file
``$GEOIPS_PACKAGES_DIR/geoips/update_this_release_note``.

You can either:

* update the appropriate release note in this repo directly.
* or update this ``CHANGELOG.rst`` file with your release
  notes, for simplicity (your notes will be moved to the
  appropriate release note in ``docs/source/releases``
  during the PR process)
