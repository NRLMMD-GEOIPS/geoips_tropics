    I don't know if this is correct, but since the data has stopped I'm going to just
    update so the tests pass..

    It appears the center moved ever-so-slightly, but it is using the same bdeck file
    in the geoips repo (which has never been updated), and there doesn't appear to be
    any other factors that would cause the center to change.
