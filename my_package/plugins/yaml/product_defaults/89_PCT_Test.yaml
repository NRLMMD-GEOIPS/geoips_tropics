# @ "product_defaults" YAML files specify a reusable set of default values for
# @ use in product specifications within GeoIPS.

# @ Replace all instances of @ within this template with appropriate values for your
# @ particular use case. Then remove all lines within this file containing "@"

# @ A "product" within GeoIPS is a set of steps required to process a dataset
# @ in a given way.

# @ The currently supported product types are specified in
# @ geoips/schema/product_defaults, with the associated required contents and
# @ formatting

# @ NOTE: Once the command line interface has been finalized, much of these
# @       instructions will be replaced with calls to the command line
# @       interface in order to identify available algorithms, colormappers, etc.
# @       In the meantime, these instructions will point you towards the code
# @       itself that is referenced in the various pieces of the product
# @       specification.

interface: product_defaults

# @ "family" is a string that identifies which operations will be applied to the
# @ input data and in which order they will be applied. This also means that it
# @ identifies which plugins need to be specified for the product.
# @
# @ For example, a product in the "interpolator_algorithm_colormapper" family will
# @ apply plugins in the order "interpolator -> algorithm -> colormapper" and will
# @ require each of those plugins to be supplied in the product definition.
family: interpolator_algorithm_colormapper

# @ "name" specifies the name of the product_defaults plugin and is how it can be
# @ referenced from a product plugin.
