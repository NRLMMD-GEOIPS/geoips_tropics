# @ This file defines a plugin for the "products" interface.
# @
# @ This products plugin belongs to the "list" family which means that it contains a
# @ list of one or more individual product plugins.
# @
# @ Each product plugin defined in this file (only one) defines a new GeoIPS product.
# @ Each product specifies which data source (source_name) it is valid for, which family
# @ family the product belongs to, which plugins to use to produce the product (e.g.
# @ which algorithm, interpolator, and colormapper plugins), and the arguments to be
# @ passed to each of those plugins.
# @
# @ Each product can be specified in two ways:
# @ - It can specify its "family" and fully specify all plugins and agruments
# @   directly here.
# @ - It can specify a "product_defaults" plugin from which to collect its "family", its
# @   plugins, and its plugin arguments. When using a "product_defaults" plugin, the
# @   default values can additionally be overridden in this product definition.
# @
# @ This file uses the "product_defaults" method of specification. The family method can
# @ be seen in the accompanying "amsr2_family.yaml" file.

# @ Product plugins always use the "products" interface
interface: products
# @ Specify that this is a list of product plugins
family: list
# @ Uniquely identify the product list plugin
name: amsr2_product_defaults
# @ Include your own descriptive docstring that describes this list of products.
